title: About me
---

I'm a passionate Software Engineer that's been writing code for more than half my life (+15 years), eventually fell in love with Functional Programming and never looked back.

Fairly familiar with advanced FP concepts, [Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) and [Category Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).

### Scala

These days I write [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) in a pure FP fasion way for a living, using cool libraries such as [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/), [Fs2](https://functional-streams-for-scala.github.io/fs2/), [Http4s](https://http4s.org/), [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/), [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless), etc.


### Haskell

I do enjoy writing Haskell code from time to time but it's no more than a hobby for now, though I have plans to start using it in production in the near future. I've used libraries such as [Servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Pipes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes), [Transient](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transient) and [Cloud Haskell](http://haskell-distributed.github.io/).
