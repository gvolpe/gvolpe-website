title: About me
---

Born and raised in a small town in Argentina. Lucky enough to have traveled around the world and having the experience of living abroad in countries like Ireland, Netherlands, Japan and Poland.

My programming journey started out in 2002, eventually discovered Functional Programming (FP) and never looked back. Nowadays, I write referentially transparent code for a living. Big fan of concurrency, functional effects, static typing, and reproducible builds.

Proficient with Haskell and Scala. Nix enthusiast.

Author of this intermediate to advanced Scala book, embracing functional programming in the enterprise.
