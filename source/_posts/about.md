title: About me
---

I am a passionate Software Engineer that has been joyfully writing code since I was 15 years old, eventually fell in love with Functional Programming (FP) and never looked back.

Fairly familiar with advanced functional programming concepts. Big fan of concurrency, functional effects and static typing.

### Scala

These days I write Scala in a pure FP fashion for a living, using cool libraries such as `cats`, `cats-effect`, `fs2`, `http4s`, `refined`, etc. You can always find me in the Gitter channels :)

### Haskell

I do enjoy writing Haskell and I have introduced it at my last job. I am familiar with many libraries and GHC extensions, having developed a couple of applications.
