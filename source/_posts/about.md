title: About me
---

I am a passionate Software Engineer that has been writing code for +15 years (a half of my life), eventually fell in love with Functional Programming (FP) and never looked back.

Fairly familiar with advanced functional programming concepts. Big fan of effectful streaming applications.

### Scala

These days I write Scala in a pure FP fashion for a living, using cool libraries such as `cats`, `cats-effect`, `fs2`, `http4s`, `circe`, `shapeless`, etc. You can always find me in the Gitter channels :)

### Haskell

I do enjoy writing Haskell and I have introduced it at my last job. I am familiar with libraries such as `dhall`, `hedis`, `lens`, `mtl`, `servant` and `wreq` among others.
